* SIFT1M
To make SIFT1M have predicates, we need to assign some values. As per the ACORN paper:

#+begin_quote
For both datasets [SIFT1M and Paper], we follow related works [25, 62, 63] to generate structured attributes and query predicates: for each base vector, we assign a random integer in the range 1 âˆ’ 12 to represent structured attributes; and for each query vector, the associated query predicate performs an exact match with a randomly chosen integer in the attribute value domain. The resulting query predicate set has a cardinality of 12.
