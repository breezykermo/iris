* TODO [Mithi] Work on Python script to provision the vectors into three different partition sets:
- SsdStandalone
- RandomPartition
- BalancedPartitioning (need to look at what they're doing in the paper).

* TODO [Cedric, Lachlan] Work out how to benchmark with SSD with Deep1M
  + Does the file format have implications for performance?
  + Should we use something equivalent to numpy memmap?
- Work out how to benchmark in memory (agent nodes) with Deep1M.
