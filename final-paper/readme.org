* Build
- Install [[https://github.com/casey/just][just]].

* Notes 
- No Github action pipeline yet, sorry folks.
- I've included the actual PDF in Git for the time being, so that we can [[./final-paper.pdf][view it]].
- The only file you need to edit to work on the proposal text is [[./proposal.org][this one]]. The syntax is just Orgmode, and you can see an example of links and citations in the text I've added. 
- Bib generated from [[https://www.zotero.org/groups/5686187/vector-databases/library][this Zotero library]].
